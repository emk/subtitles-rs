## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2024-03-07

### Fixed

- Updated all dependencies from their ancient 2017 versions to their latest versions.
- Ported code to Rust 2021 edition.
- Switched error-handling from the deprecated `failure` to `anyhow`, and removed dependency on `common_failures`.
- Moved binary builds to GitHub.

## [0.4.5] - 2017-12-08

### Added

- We now have official binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows.
- We now have a progress bar for media exports!

### Fixed

- The `uchardet` and `cld2` dependencies have been replaced with pure Rust dependencies. This makes it easier to support many platforms and to build from source.
- Argument parsing has been totally overhauled, so help messages should be better.
- Error formatting has been standardized and improved, so it's easier to figure out why something went wrong.
- We now support *.srt files generated by Aeneas, which is excellent for syncing audiobooks with text. These broke before because Aeneas occasionally generates 0-second subtitles, which we rejected as invalid.
